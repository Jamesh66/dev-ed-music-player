A music player app created as part of The Developed By Ed React course. 

This app plays takes data from chillhop.com and displays it through the UI, giving the user a choice of eight different song choices and displays the album artwork for each track. 

The styling was created using Sass although I would possibly use styled components in the future as I find this much easier to add to style new components much quicker.
